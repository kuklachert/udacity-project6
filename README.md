## Project 6 - Illya Payanov

### Summary

In this project, I decided to visualise the unemployment rates of the G8 countries in the period between 1991 and 2014 (time series extracted from the World Bank database). To add further context, I accompanied the unemployment time series with the timeline of major global events as well as the timeline of political changes (new Head of State or Head of the Executive) in the respective countries.

The aim of the infographic was to let the user explore the data and make her own conclusions about what drives unemployment rates across the world. In my opinion there are multiple stories one can find in this graphic, e.g. some countries' remarkable decrease in unemployment after changes in power (most notably Germany during Angela Merkel's reign), the devastating effect of the global financial crisis all over the world, or the correlation between political stability (low number of changes in power) with low/decreasing unemployment, which can be well seen on the examples of Italy and Germany (but is contradicted by Japan).
